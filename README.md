A personal repo for practicing

When I tried to push test data to github, there always a notice that "error: src refspec master does not match any".
As usual, the push order is "git push -u origin master", but Github change this order recently, it became "git push -u origin main"!!!
Finally, I took a hundreds of hours to uploat these little tiny test f**king files.
What a f**king day!!
